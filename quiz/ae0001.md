# Best Suited Apartment

Imagine that you are moving to a new location, and all the candidate apartments are in blocks of one street. In each block there are some buildings that you value e.g. office, supermarket, school, etc.

Choose the best suited apartment that can minimize the farest distance that you have to walk to all the places you value.

blocks = [
    {
        "gym": false,
        "school": true,
        "store": false,
    },
    {
        "gym": true,
        "school": false,
        "store": false,
    },
    {
