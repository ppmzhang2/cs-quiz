# Sorting

## Merge Sort

Divide and conquer, sorting by merging from the smallest part after dividing.

2. [without-splitting](../src/merge_sort_ya.py)

## Quick Sort

Divide and conquer, similar to merge sort but with a top-down method instead of bottom-up: sorting when dividing, and splicing all together finally.
