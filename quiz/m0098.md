# Validate Binary Search Tree

TAG: dynamic-programming, tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). A valid BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
  key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's
  key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

```
  2
 / \
1   3
```

* Input: root = [2,1,3]
* Output: true

Example 2:

```
  5
 / \
1   4
   / \
  3   6
```

* Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
* Output: false
* Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
* `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solving Idea

One solution is an "explosive" structure, which can be transformed into two sub-structures, containing the traversal sequence.
