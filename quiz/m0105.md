# construct binary tree from pre-order and in-order traversal

TAG: tree, zipper

Given pre-order and in-order traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note: you may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Example:

* pre-order: `[3, 9, 20, 15, 7]`
* in-order: `[9, 3, 15, 20, 7]`

output:

```
  3
 / \
9  20
  /  \
 15   7
```

## Solving Idea

A binary tree can be re-constructed from its pre-order and in-order traversals, or single depth-first-search traversal with NULL values (empty tree). You may want to include a zipper structure to avoid recursion.
