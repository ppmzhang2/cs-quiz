# Pow-x-n

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e. `x^n`).

* Example 1:
  * Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
  * Output: 1024.00000
* Example 2:
  * Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
  * Output: 9.26100
* Example 3:
  * Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
  * Output: 0.25000

Explanation: `2^(-2) = 1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25`

Constraints:

* `-100.0 < x < 100.0`
* `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
* `-10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4`

## Solving Idea

Suppose we can only implement for now a naive pow function, which can calculate any base to the power n (n = 0, 1, 2), then `3^11` can be seen as `sqr(3^5) * 3^1`, and `3^10` as `sqr(3^5) * 3^0`, where `sqr` is the square function. This expression now contains `3^5` instead of `3^11`, which can be disassembled recursively.

What we need now however, is a machine which can be tranformed from one state to another, and eventually a product of naive pows: `square(x^m) * x` or `square(x^m) * 1`, where `x` is the base provided and `m < n` (`n` is the provided power).

The calculus `square(y) * x` or `square(y) * 1` involves three elements:

1. the original base `x`
2. power of the second multiplier i.e. 0 or 1
3. new base `y`

We donate this calculus as `f`, and regarding our example, `3^11 = f(3, 1, 3^5)`, `3^5 = f(3, 1, 3^2)`, and finally `3^2 = f(3, 0, 3)`. We can record the second argument all the way through the disassembling process: `(0, 1, 1)`.

Now we can go back up as every argument is a known number: first we need to pick up the sequence we saved, which can be applied to `f` as the second argument, and for the third argument the initial value is always the same with the original base `x`:

1. `f(3, 0, 3) = 9`
2. `f(3, 1, 9) = 243`
3. `f(3, 1, 243) = 177147`
