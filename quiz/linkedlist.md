# Linked List

- A linked list is nothing but a collection of values, each of which has the
  capability to point to some other value.
- The key is the specialized values with pointers, a.k.a. nodes.
  - A single node (head) is enough to represent a singly linked list.
  - Two nodes (head and tail) are enough to represent a doubly linked list.
  - A linked list is the simplest data structure that nodes can represent.
    Combined with, for example, a hash table, the hybrid data structure can
    build a LRU cache.
- Linked list vs. Tree
  - Topologically, a linked list is equivalent to a unary tree.
  - A doubly linked list is a unary tree whose nodes can reference their
    parents.
